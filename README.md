# KT_SafeRM
A bash scripting project that creates a script which is identical to the rm command unix/linux based systems that allows the interactive option to prompt by default,
 to ask if you want the file to be deleted and saves these files or directories into a .Trash folder.  

just to check how this git thing works.
